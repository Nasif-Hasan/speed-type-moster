                <p class="p-5">The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, where as sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time.</p>

                <p class="p-5">We often identify the top-level scope as the global scope. In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like. You can also use them stand-alone with a simple begin-end curly braces {}, not to be confused with empty object literals.</p>

                <p class="p-5">The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                <p class="p-5">Undefined is a built-in JavaScript type. Any property that has not been assigned a value, assumes the undefined value. A function without a return statement, or a function with an empty return statement returns undefined. The value of an unsupplied function argument is undefined.</p>
